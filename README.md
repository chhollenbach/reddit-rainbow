# Reddit Stock Portfolio
A full stack side project. The various pieces (subject to change):

- Python bot using PRAW to scrape Reddit comments for any comments of the form "buy [stock ticker]" or "sell [stock ticker]"
- Database to store information of a mock portfolio of stocks Reddit buys and sells over time
- A website to visualize all this in a fun way using React
- A backend server to coordinate the above pieces
